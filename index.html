                    Discord is my favorite company in the world. 
                    I‚Äôd honestly be embarrassed to show you my screen time stats, but that‚Äôs only because Discord has been the foundation of so many of my friendships, hobbies, and late-night game sessions. 
                    I even manage my own 1,000-member community and proudly subscribe to Nitro just so I can participate in every community I care about. 
                    <br/><br/>

                    Professionally, my background is rooted in infrastructure and virtualization. 
                    I currently lead product strategy for VMware‚Äôs ESXi operating system, managing critical components for edge computing, hardware ecosystems, and large-scale, real-time workloads. 
                    I‚Äôve shipped platform features used by millions, partnered with OEMs to launch next-generation hardware, and introduced telemetry-driven improvements that reduced customer issues and streamlined our release process. 
                    My early career as a network engineer and solutions architect gave me hands-on experience with performance-sensitive systems and helped me develop the ability to translate technical complexity into real-world impact.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I know there is a gap between my B2B enterprise background and Discord‚Äôs consumer first platform. 
                    But what I bring is a mix of deep technical, platform-level thinking, and a builder‚Äôs mindset. 
                    I operate with grit, and I care deeply about users because I am one. 
                    If given the opportunity, I promise you won‚Äôt find a more committed or hard-working member of the product team.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Discord has already changed my life by giving me community and connection. 
                    Thank you for considering my application.
